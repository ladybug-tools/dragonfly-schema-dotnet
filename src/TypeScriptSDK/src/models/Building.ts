Cases where this input is most useful include sloped walls and certain types of domed roofs that become tedious to implement with RoofSpecification. Matching the Honeybee Room.story property to the Dragonfly Story.display_name of an object within the unique_stories will effectively place the Honeybee Room on that Story for the purposes of floor_area, exterior_wall_area, etc. However, note that the Honeybee Room.multiplier property takes precedence over whatever multiplier is assigned to the Dragonfly Story that the Room.story may reference.

However, when it is unknown which roof geometries correspond to which stories, this Building-level attribute may be used and each roof geometry will automatically be added to the best Story in the Building upon serialization to Python. This automatic assignment will happen by checking for overlaps between the Story Room2Ds and the Roof geometry in plan. When a given roof geometry overlaps with several Stories, the top-most Story will get the roof geometry assigned to it unless this top Story has a floor_height above the roof geometry, in which case the next highest story will be checked until a compatible one is found. */
