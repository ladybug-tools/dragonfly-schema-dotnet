# DragonflyDotNet.Model.SingleWindow

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Width** | **double** | A number for the window width. Note that, if this width is applied to a wall that is too narrow for this width, the generated window will automatically be shortened when it is applied to the wall. In this way, setting the width to be &#x60;float(\&quot;inf\&quot;)&#x60; will create parameters that always generate a ribboin window. | 
**Height** | **double** | A number for the window height. Note that, if this height is applied to a wall that is too short for this height, the generated window will automatically be shortened when it is applied to the wall. | 
**Type** | **string** |  | [optional] [default to "SingleWindow"]
**SillHeight** | **double** | A number for the window sill height. | [optional] [default to 1.0M]
