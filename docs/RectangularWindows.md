Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Origins** | **List&lt;List&lt;double&gt;&gt;** | An array of 2D points within the plane of the wall for the origin of each window. Each point should be a list of 2 (x, y) values. The wall plane is assumed to have an origin at the first point of the wall segment and an X-axis extending along the length of the segment. The wall plane Y-axis always points upwards. Therefore, both X and Y values of each origin point should be positive. |

**Heights** | **List&lt;double&gt;** | An array of postive numbers for the window heights. The length of this list must match the length of the origins. | 
**Type** | **string** |  | [optional] [default to "RectangularWindows"]
